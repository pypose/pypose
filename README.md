## PyPose: A Library for Robot Learning with Physics-based Optimization

![robot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8695500/193484553-2da66824-4461-4aca-ad8c-b17c05bef067.png)

Deep learning has had remarkable success in robotic perception, but its data-centric nature suffers when it comes to generalizing to ever-changing environments. By contrast, physics-based optimization generalizes better, but it does not perform as well in complicated tasks due to the lack of high-level semantic information and the reliance on manual parametric tuning. To take advantage of these two complementary worlds, we present PyPose: a **robotics-oriented**, **PyTorch-based** library that combines **deep perceptual models** with **physics-based optimization techniques**. Our design goal for PyPose is to make it **user-friendly**, **efficient**, and **interpretable** with a tidy and well-organized architecture. Using an **imperative style interface**, it can be easily integrated into **real-world robotic applications**.

#### Examples

1. The following code sample shows how to rotate random points and compute the gradient of batched rotation.

```python
>>> import torch, pypose as pp

>>> # A random so(3) LieTensor
>>> r = pp.randn_so3(2, requires_grad=True)
    so3Type LieTensor:
    tensor([[ 0.1606,  0.0232, -1.5516],
            [-0.0807, -0.7184, -0.1102]], requires_grad=True)

>>> R = r.Exp() # Equivalent to: R = pp.Exp(r)
    SO3Type LieTensor:
    tensor([[ 0.0724,  0.0104, -0.6995,  0.7109],
            [-0.0395, -0.3513, -0.0539,  0.9339]], grad_fn=<AliasBackward0>)

>>> p = R @ torch.randn(3) # Rotate random point
    tensor([[ 0.8045, -0.8555,  0.5260],
            [ 0.3502,  0.8337,  0.9154]], grad_fn=<ViewBackward0>)

>>> p.sum().backward()     # Compute gradient
>>> r.grad                 # Print gradient
    tensor([[-0.7920, -0.9510,  1.7110],
            [-0.2659,  0.5709, -0.3855]])
```

2. This example shows how to estimate batched inverse of transform by a second-order optimizer. Two usage options for a `scheduler` are provided, each of which can work independently.

```python
>>> from torch import nn
>>> import torch, pypose as pp
>>> from pypose.optim import LM
>>> from pypose.optim.strategy import Constant
>>> from pypose.optim.scheduler import StopOnPlateau

>>> class InvNet(nn.Module):

        def __init__(self, *dim):
            super().__init__()
            init = pp.randn_SE3(*dim)
            self.pose = pp.Parameter(init)

        def forward(self, input):
            error = (self.pose @ input).Log()
            return error.tensor()

>>> device = torch.device("cuda")
>>> input = pp.randn_SE3(2, 2, device=device)
>>> invnet = InvNet(2, 2).to(device)
>>> strategy = Constant(damping=1e-4)
>>> optimizer = LM(invnet, strategy=strategy)
>>> scheduler = StopOnPlateau(optimizer, steps=10, patience=3, decreasing=1e-3, verbose=True)

>>> # 1st option, full optimization
>>> scheduler.optimize(input=input)

>>> # 2nd option, step optimization
>>> while scheduler.continual():
        loss = optimizer.step(input)
        scheduler.step(loss)

>>> # Note: remove one of the above options for usage!
```
