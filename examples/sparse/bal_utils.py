def reprojerr(pose, points, pixels, intrinsics, distortions, point_index, camera_index):
    """
    Calculates batched per-pixel reprojection error considering camera distortion.
    Using BAL's suggestion:

    We use a pinhole camera model; the parameters we estimate for each camera area rotation R, a translation t, a focal length f and two radial distortion parameters k1 and k2. The formula for projecting a 3D point X into a camera R,t,f,k1,k2 is:
    P  =  R * X + t       (conversion from world to camera coordinates)
    p  = -P / P.z         (perspective division)
    p' =  f * r(p) * p    (conversion to pixel coordinates)
    where P.z is the third (z) coordinate of P. In the last equation, r(p) is a function that computes a scaling factor to undo the radial distortion:
    r(p) = 1.0 + k1 * ||p||^2 + k2 * ||p||^4.

    Args:
        pose (``LieTensor``): The camera extrinsics.
            The shape has to be (..., 7).
        points (``torch.Tensor``): The object points in world coordinate.
            The shape has to be (..., N, 3).
        pixels (``torch.Tensor``): The image points. The associated pixel.
            The shape has to be (..., N, 2).
        intrinsics (``torch.Tensor``): intrinsic matrices.
            The shape has to be (..., 3, 3).
        distortions (``torch.Tensor``): The camera distortions.
            The shape has to be (..., 2).
        point_index (``torch.Tensor``): The indices of points.
            The shape has to be (..., N).
        camera_index (``torch.Tensor``): The indices of cameras.
